mov eax, [ebx+esi*4] ; This instruction assumes that esi is a valid index into the array pointed to by ebx. However, if esi is out of bounds (e.g., negative or larger than the array size), it will lead to accessing memory outside the allocated array, resulting in a segmentation fault or other unpredictable behavior.  This is a common error when working with array indexing in assembly language.  The code lacks bounds checking, which is crucial for robust programs.
